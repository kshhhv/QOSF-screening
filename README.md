# QOSF-screening

Hey,

This repository contains the screening task submission for the [QOSF mentorship](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/). The second problem is attempted in the file [Task 2.ipynb](https://github.com/kshhhv/QOSF-screening/blob/master/Task%202.ipynb). In case there is some issues with rendering of the notebook, visit [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kshhhv/QOSF-screening/blob/master/Task%202.ipynb).

While running locally, do upgrade the required package by running the first cell. Also, to import noise model the IBMQ accounts needs to be loaded.

Thank you!
