# QOSF-screening

Hey,

This repository contains the screening task for the [QOSF mentorship](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/). The submission jupyter notebook is Task 2.ipynb. In case there is some issues with rendering of the file, visit [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kshhhv/QOSF-screening/blob/master/Task%202.ipynb).

While running locally, do upgrade the required package by running the first cell. Also, to import noise model the IBMQ accounts needs to be loaded.

Thank you!
